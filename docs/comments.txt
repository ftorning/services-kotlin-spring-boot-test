I am including in this directory a few postman requests I used for testing

I added several tests to RewardsApplicationTests, although they are roughly organized

This is my first foray into Kotlin -- after years of Python and JS programming it was a bit of a shock, but after some
practice and reading through the docs, it began to click.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding my submission and thank you for consideration!
